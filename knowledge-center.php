                                <h2>Importance of Private Company Research Today</h2>
                                <p> Our research is not a buy rating or a sell rating of a publicly traded stock. Awhile some of us were long veterans of sell-side and buy-side portfolio managers and sector analysts, we focus on private companies where research is more difficult due to transparencies and less market media. Our research also comes from actual experiences by analysts but also entrepreneurs and industry experts. I always give an example that if you were to invest in a restaurant, wouldn't you want to look around the foot traffic (location), try the food, speak to the owner and the chef before buying the a stake? More and more public companies are traded by AI, ETFs and becoming less portion of most institutional funds (endowments). Minority investors have less power as they usually invest with management without noticing. Simply, it's not an investment but trading stock.</p>

                                <h3>Additional Services</h3>
                                <p>When you study for the CFA, we learn the importance of asset allocation decisions. We also do an allocation study, manager research, quantitative and qualitive. This is what most institutional consultants stop. Most of us actually know the alternative managers that manage your funds in person. We have debates about what is coming next. While trading cost are nearing zero, how do these guys get paid? by lending your securities.</p>
